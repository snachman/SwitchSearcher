# Switch Searcher
[TwitterBot](https://twitter.com/SearcherSwitch)

This is a Twitter bot that reads the Target website and checks for availablity of the ver. 2 Nintendo Switch in both gray and neon. If it is available and has the option of ordering ahead it tweets that along with a Google Maps link to the store. If it is reported in stock but does not have order pickup as an option, that is noted in the tweet but still includes the Google Maps link.

This started as a personal need but decided that it might be a fun bot to make. I can't express enough how important social distancing is at the time this bot was launched and that frivilous trips to the store should not be made.
